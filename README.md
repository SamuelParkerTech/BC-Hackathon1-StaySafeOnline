In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

If time allows we would like to add more video content on each page. Improved styling and responsiveness.
Fourth Page / Blogs and Scare Stories. News. We would like to add. 
I would like to make it more responsive, currently certain images/content/logos are removed on smaller screens as this was an done to make the site better looking in the short time we had. 
More padding to spacing pages, center youtube video on all devices (maybe replace with a newer version).

# Other General Project Advice
We struggled a bit with Github forks and forking, although we were able to resolve this. As our first time it was a bit daunting. 
I (Samuel) struggled with Github Projects page as I had not used this before, I used Trello as an alternative as I have experience of viewing these boards before.
